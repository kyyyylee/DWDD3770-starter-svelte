:books: Example for Section 5: Connecting AuthJS to OAuth providers is found on the 'Home' page of my site linked [HERE](https://dwdd-3770-starter-svelte.vercel.app/)

    - When you first arrive on my site, you will be prompted to signup/signin with GitHub before you are able to navigate throughout the site. 
    - After you have successfully logged in, you should see your GitHub icon in the top right corner. You should also see a message on the home page stating "You are currently logged in as XXX"
    - You can log out by either pressing the "Logout" button on the home page (this will automatically log you out) or you can click your icon in the corner which will prompt you with a modal before it logs you out. 

:computer: Source code for Section 5 can be found [HERE - hooks file](src/hooks.server.ts), [HERE - +page file](src/routes/+page.svelte) & [HERE - +layout file](src/routes/+layout.svelte)

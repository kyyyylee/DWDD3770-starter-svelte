:books: Examples for Section 4 (tween, spring, transitions & animate) are found on the 'Motion' page linked [HERE](https://dwdd-3770-starter-svelte.vercel.app/tutorial/motion)

    - Tween & spring example is toward the bottom of the page in the 'How do you rate my website?' section.

    - Another spring example is in the stiffness & damping secction.

    - An animate directive is found on the first sectin of the page 'Taylor Swift Concert Set List' - the song elements animate when shuffled!

    - The first UI element transition is found on the tutorial navigation throughout the site! Each button that links to a different page in tutorials has a css transition on hover. 

    - The second transition can be found on the Motions page in the 'Want to see whats happening behind stage?' When you choose the option to show the code block, the element appears with a JS transition. 

    - The last transition example can be found in the 'How do you rate my website?' section. Once you click 'Submit' a modal element transitions in with a Svelte blur transition.
